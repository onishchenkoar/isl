# Introduction to Statistical Learning (with applications in Python!)
Execises for *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* textbook. The textbook is available for free at https://www.statlearning.com/. The authors suggest doing the labs in R; I am doing them in Python. Datasets, converted from R format to CSV, are taken from [this repository](https://github.com/dsnair/ISLR/tree/master/data).
